Weather Watch is an essential and simple-to-use weather forecast application for all of your activities and daily use.

## Description

This application is a fully featured weather scouting app that showcases the use of several different APIs in order to create a convenient and easy-to-use application for every-day weather needs. This app logs the last viewed user-inputted city into local storage for simple and recurring day-to-day reference and shows information including: temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The app also has cards that display a five day forecast of the selected city.
